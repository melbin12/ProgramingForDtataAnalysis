Air pollution has become one of the most significant environmental and public health challenges of the 21st century. As urbanisation and industrialisation intensify, particularly in megacities like Beijing, the adverse effects of polluted air on human health and ecosystems continue to escalate. Exposure to airborne pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulphur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O₃) is directly associated with increased risks of respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature mortality (Brauer et al., 2021). To mitigate these health threats and support informed decision-making, there is an increasing need for data-driven systems that can analyse, interpret, and visualise air quality trends efficiently.
This project addresses the problem by developing an end-to-end data analysis and application development pipeline using Python and associated libraries. The selected dataset comprises hourly air quality measurements from twelve monitoring stations in Beijing between 2013 and 2017. This dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, includes both pollutant concentrations and meteorological data such as wind speed, temperature, pressure, dew point, and rainfall, allowing for comprehensive multi-variable analysis (Li et al., 2024).
The overall aim of this assignment is to process, analyse, and visualise the dataset through a multipage application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates user interaction. The assignment tasks involve: (1) importing and merging data from selected stations, (2) conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), (3) developing a machine learning model to predict PM2.5 levels, (4) creating a Streamlit-based GUI, and (5) maintaining version control through GitHub. These components reflect the broader application of programming for real-world environmental data analysis.
This work not only enhances digital and analytical competencies but also aligns with sustainability goals by empowering users to interpret pollution trends and act based on data-driven insights (Lim et al., 2020).
